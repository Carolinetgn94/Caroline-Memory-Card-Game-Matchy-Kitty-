# Caroline-Memory-Card-Game-Matchy-Kitty-

This is a memory card game centered around cats!
The rule of the game is very simple. 

1. The game consists of a deck of cards, each featuring a cute kitty. These cards are arranged in a grid, face-down, at the beginning of the game.

2. When you click start, the timer will start and record the number of flips you made. 

3. The game is won when all pairs of cards have been successfully matched.

4. You may restart the game if you feel you don't have enough time to complete! Best of luck!
